ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

My name is Jaime Leoz, I'm from Spain, Mallorca. Now a days I live in Madrid.

I have been living/working around Europe and U.S.A (as exchange student). I'm always thrilled to work in international environments and in English.

I have been working 9 years specialized in SEO (search engine optimization).

#### Now I'm finishing a full-time Bootcamp in Data Analytics at Iron Hack - 9 weeks - learning Python (pandas, numpy, machine learning..) , SQL, MongoDB, Tableau, PowerBI. Ofcourse focused on finding data, cleaning , organizing, EAD/EDT, Visualizations and reporting.

# I'm changing career!

I have been always a technology enthusiast, and I been wondering for too long about programming code like python or JavaScript.
In my previous jobs I been working quite closely to developers & product owners. Since my job required optimizing webs, was important
to understand how things worked & performed like backend, frontend, servers, databases. As well I was constantly playing with data provided from different tools like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Google Search Console, Screaming Frog and many more in order to make priorotize decisions and reporting.

By the way, I was working in SEO ( Search Engine Optimization). Is surprisingly a very data driven job, anything we do as SEO's needs to be analyzed, cleaned and reviewed, we have lots of tools that provide us differently data. Although requires constant manual work to put them together.

I been doing all the steps of a data scientist all along! without knowing, of course, using excel...


## How did I worked with Data?

This is how I worked with data (back then in excel):

1. First digging around the tools, you can play online most of the times, but when you need to connect things that means manual work, exporting and excel.
2. Put all different files, from different tools together in an excel and review which columns to keep and reviewing if the data that I'm keeping is    	consistent.
3. After deciding and a bit of cleaning is required joining tables to provide a bigger picture
4. Start the analysis
5. Grab the important data
6. List actions
7. Prioritize actions based on a balance between fast to action & great impact ( time of production/conversions)
8. Use the data for creating Dashboards, presentations and meetings.


## The Biggest challenges I had & why I love Puzzles.

My biggest challenges always have been regarding Migrating webs.

When you deal with big websites filled with thousands of urls based on different countries, languages, makes  mapping the URLs to new ones quite challenging. There is a lot of information that is very delicate.

> A bad migration will affect a website organic positions and conversions.
	

Migrations require scrapping the web, saving the information, organizing it, add data from other tools to complete it, keeping broad communication
with a lot of teams ( from Brand, UIX, Developers, Stakeholders, Content Managers, sometimes Freelancers and anyone that can help) to be able to make the right decisions on how to proceed and how other teams have to proceed when making changes.


I loved being part of this processes that could last months, months that are challenging, required patience, good communication, working with other teammates & departments, and most of all the responsibility at my hands, being able to solve the Data puzzles before migrating the web. At the end is a very delicate job that someone has to do!
