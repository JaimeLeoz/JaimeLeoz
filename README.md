ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

My name is Jaime Leoz, I'm from Spain, Mallorca. Now a days I live in Madrid.

I have been living/working around Europe and U.S.A (as exchange student). I'm always thrilled to work in international environments and in English.

I have been working 9 years specialized in SEO (search engine optimization).

#### Now I'm finishing a full-time Bootcamp in Data Analytics at Iron Hack - 9 weeks - learning Python (pandas, numpy, machine learning..) , SQL, MongoDB, Tableau, PowerBI. Ofcourse focused on finding data, cleaning , organizing, EAD/EDT, Visualizations and reporting.

# I'm changing career!

I have been always a technology enthusiast, and I been wondering for too long about programming code like python or JavaScript.
In my previous jobs I been working quite closely to developers & product owners. Since my job required optimizing webs, was important
to understand how things worked & performed like backend, frontend, servers, databases. As well I was constantly playing with data provided from different tools like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Google Search Console, Screaming Frog and many more in order to make priorotize decisions and reporting.

By the way, I was working in SEO ( Search Engine Optimization). Is surprisingly a very data driven job, anything we do as SEO's needs to be analyzed, cleaned and reviewed, we have lots of different data types and tools that provide us differently data whhich requires constant manual work to put them together, since there is very few automatizations possible, either are expensive or quite hard to deploy.

I been doing all the steps of a data scientist all along! without knowing, of course, using excel...


## How did I worked with Data?

This is how I worked with data (back then in excel):

    1, Digging the different tools to find new data and seasonality ,for example, then exporting the data in a cvs excel file.
    2, Joining different files, from different tools together in an excel and review which columns to keep and reviewing if the data is consistent.
    3, After deciding and a bit of cleaning we look for the bigger picture
    4, Start the analysis
    5, Grab the important data
    6, List actions
    7, Prioritize actions based on a balance between fast to action & great impact ( time of production/conversions)
    8, Use the data for creating Dashboards, presentations and meetings.


## The Biggest challenges I had & why I love Puzzles.

My biggest challenges always have been regarding Migrating webs.

When you deal with big websites filled with thousands of urls based on different countries, languages, makes  mapping the URLs to new ones quite challenging. There is a lot of delicate information that requires a lot of attention.

> A bad migration will affect a website organic positions and conversions.
	

Migrations require scrapping the web, saving the information, organizing it, adding data from other tools to complete it, keeping broad communication
with a lot of teams ( from Brand, UIX, Developers, Stakeholders, Content Managers, sometimes Freelancers and anyone that can help) to be able to make the right decisions on how to proceed and how other teams have to proceed when making changes.


I loved being part of this processes that could last months, months that are challenging, required patience, good communication, working with other teammates & departments, and most of all the responsibility at my hands, being able to solve the Data puzzles before migrating the web. At the end is a very delicate job that someone has to do!

### Communication Skills

    My jobs required constant and direct communication and to adapt it to the different stakeholders
    Required to communicate with different departments and adapt to each of one the content and specifics of the info to:

        Product Owners
        Developers
        UIX
        PR
        Brand

        Other Marketing channels


## What I'm bringing to the table? HARD SKILLS

    Great with any tool, I learn fast (I have used too many in SEO)
    Python ( NumPy, Pandas, loops, functions)
    SQL and MongoDB
    Web scraping
    Analyzing Data
    Cleaning Data: EAD/ETL
    Tableau, Power BI
    Presentations
    Excel, Word and PPT savvy
    Google Analytics/ Adobe Analytics
    I'm a certified scrum master since I like what it means: teamwork, support others and help them do it their way.


### Reporting

    Creating dashboards on Google Data Studio
    Creating databases on excel
    Creating presentations/Reports on PPT for different porpoises:
        Reporting to executive Stakeholders (Heads of Marketing and CEO's)
        Reporting to Managers
        Reporting to different teams
	

### Another example of work processes : Reviewing the web status:

    Analyzing data with an internal perspective:
        changes that the SEO team made
        Changes from other other teams (marketing, content, UIX)
        Changes in the web code etc.

    Analyzing the data from external perspective:

        Is there a new trend of search
        Is there any seasonality
        Specific news about our Industry

    Resume it and make some checks with different tools:

        Reviewing past data and if it is congruent

    Make some pointers
        Just save the data and opinions made
        Review them with the different teams for contrast

    Make action plans if necessary
        Prioritize actions related to the new findings.
