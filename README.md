ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

My name is Jaime Leoz, I'm from Spain, Mallorca. Now a days I live in Madrid.

I have been living/working around Europe and U.S.A (as exchange student). I'm always thrilled to work in international environments and in English.

I have been working 9 years specialized in SEO (search engine optimization).

###Â Now I'm finishing a full-time Bootcamp in Data Analytics at Iron Hack - 9 weeks - learning Python (pandas, numpy, machine learning..) , SQL, MongoDB, Tableau, PowerBI. Ofcourse focused on finding data, cleaning , organizing, EAD/EDT, Visualizations and reporting.

# I'm changing career!

I have been always a technology enthusiast, and I been wondering for too long about programming code like python or JavaScript.
In my previous jobs I been working quite closely to developers & product owners. Since my job required optimizing webs, was important
to understand how things worked & performed like backend, frontend, servers, databases. As well I was constantly playing with data provided from different tools like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Google Search Console, Screaming Frog and many more in order to make priorotize decisions and reporting.

By the way, I was working in SEO ( Search Engine Optimization). Is surprisingly a very data driven job, anything we do as SEO's needs to be analyzed, cleaned and reviewed, we have lots of tools that provide us differently data. Although requires constant manual work to put them together.

I been doing all the steps of a data scientist all along! without knowing, of course, using excel...


## How did I worked with Data?

This is how I worked with data (back then in excel):

1. First digging around the tools, you can play online most of the times, but when you need to connect things that means manual work, exporting and excel.
2. Put all different files, from different tools together in an excel and review which columns to keep and reviewing if the data that I'm keeping is    	consistent.
..*2.1 In SEO data is always very variable, unlimited depending on the needs, and not always comes in the right format.
4. After deciding and a bit of cleaning is required joining tables to provide a bigger picture
5. Start the analysis
6. Grab the important data
7. List actions
8. Prioritize actions based on a balance between fast to action & great impact ( time of production/conversions)
9. Use the data for creating Dashboards, presentations and meetings.


## The Biggest challenge and why I love Puzzles.

My biggest challenges always have been regarding Migrating webs. This is as complex as it gets. Of course a small website is simpler, but requires patience and eye for detail.

When you deal with big websites, different countries, languages, thousands of URLs, mapping the URLs to new ones, is when it gets challenging.

> As a SEO I looked for accomplishing the best results that affect less as possible the organic rankings of a web. Which a lot of webs depend on, since they have a lot of conversions through this marketing channel.

> A bad migration can literally drown your web and would be a pity to lose the effort made during years in few clicks.
	

Migrations require scrapping the web, saving the information, organizing it, add data from other tools to complete it, keeping broad communication
with a lot of teams, from Brand, UIX, Developers, Stakeholders, Content Managers, sometimes Freelancers and anyone that can help.

Making tough decisions

I loved being part of this processes that could last months which were challenging, required patience, good communication, teaching key aspects, talking with other teammates,
and most of all the responsibility at my hands, being able to solve the Data puzzles that had to be solved before migrating the web. Very delicate job.

A lot of processes that get improved over time.

### Reviewing the web status:

    Analyzing data with an internal perspective:
        changes that the SEO team made
        Changes from other other teams (marketing, content, UIX)
        Changes in the web code etc.

    Analyzing the data from external perspective:

        Is there a new trend of search
        Is there any seasonality
        Specific news about our Industry

    Resume it and make some checks with different tools:

        Reviewing past data and if it is congruent

    Make some pointers
        Just save the data and opinions made
        Review them with the different teams for contrast

    Make action plans if necessary
        Prioritize actions related to the new findings.

    Creating presentations on PPT for different porpoises:
        Reporting to executive Stakeholders (Heads of Marketing and CEO's)

        Reporting to different teams
